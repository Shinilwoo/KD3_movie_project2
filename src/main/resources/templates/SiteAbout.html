                   <p>Possible reasons: <br>
                   1. Your image is not an original anime screenshot.<br>
                   2. The anime has not been added to database yet.<br>
                   3. Your image is of modified.</p>
              
                <p class="how p">
                    Regarding 1. You may try to use SauceNAO and iqdb.org which is best for searching anime artwork.<br>
                    Regarding 2. New animes currently airing would be analyzed around 24 hours after TV broadcast. <br>
					Long-running animes/ cartoons are excluded at this stage.<br>
					See "What anime are indexed" at the bottom of this page.<br>
                    As for 3. The image search algorithm is designed for almost-exact match, not similar match.	<br>
					It analyzthe color layout of the image.	<br>
					So, when your image is not a full un-cropped original 16:9 screenshot (i.e.cropped image), the search would likely fail. <br>
                    Color is an important factor for the correct search, if heavy tints and filters are applied to the screensho (i.e. grayscale, contrast, saturation, brightness, sepia), too much information are lost.<br> 
					In this case the search would also fail.<br>
					Edge Histogram can solve this issue by ignoring colors and only search edges.<br>
			  		But I am running out of computing resource to support another image descriptor. 					<br>
                    Image transform is also an important factor.					<br>
					If the image is flipped, mirrored or rotated, the search wouldalso fail.					<br>
                    Text occupied too much of the image.					<br>
					 Large texts on the image would interfere the original image.					<br>
					  The system is not smart enough to ignore the text.					 <br>
                    If your image has too little distinguish features (e.g. dark images or images with large plain blocks of
                    plain colors), the search would also fail.					<br>
                    Searching with a real photo (of an anime) definitely won't work. 					<br>
